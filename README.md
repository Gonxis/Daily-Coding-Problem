<h1>Daily Coding Problem</h1>

This is a repository I made to be always active and try to solve every day at least one coding problem.

I will be using TDD, and the programming language that I will use is JavaScript.

In order to test my work, I just installed jest so I can see if my code is OK and pass all te test cases.

So first of all, I will need:

`npm install`

and after that:

`npm test`

So I can see if my code is running against different test cases I wanted to check.
